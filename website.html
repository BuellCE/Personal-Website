                The front end of this website was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also decided to use Bootstrap since it allows developers
                to easily scale their site for mobile platforms without any limitations. I used some JQuery since it allows more functionality
                than basic javascript while remaining simple.
            </p>
            <p class="double-text-spacing" >
                Since this website was created using Github Pages as the host, there was some difficulties surrounding development. Github pages only allows
                static pages to be served to the client, and does so directly from a github repository. This meant I couldn't use a back-end templating engine
                to dynamically render pages. Typically I would handle this on the back-end using Node.js Express with Handlebars, as I have a lot of experience 
                with it, however I decided to stick with Github Pages and find another work around.
            </p>
            <p class="double-text-spacing">
                Templating is usually important since it enables developers to avoid repetition in code. Take this website for example, every page on this site
                has a navigation bar at the top, and a footer at the bottom. With several pages on this website, it would be bad practice to have each page include
                their own navigation bar and footer elements. What if I needed to make a change?            
            </p>
            <p class="double-text-spacing">
                My solution was to use JQuery to load in the code of a separate html document and place it inside an element of the rendered page. 
                For example, lets say I had two HTML files: home.html and nav.html. When the client loads home.html, the JQuery code will execute and pull the 
                code from nav.html and place it all within an element in home.html. All the code found in nav.html is now a child element contained in home.html.
            </p>

                Making a website this simple should typically go off without a hitch. Besides the one work around, the process of making the website was
                very simple since I have had prior experience.
            </p>
            <p class="double-text-spacing">
                Thanks in part to bootstrap, this website works very well on mobile as well, and can dynamically change based on the size of the browser.
